Today is Friday! 

The weekend is soon.

It's a good day.

We can't wait for the weekend.

Starting today, and continuing past the weekend is an Ice Sculpture Festival.

One of the sculptures is near the campus.

It's designed and created by an artist.

It sounds fun to walk by, especially since it's so close.

There's also some campus events today and this weekend to go to.

It's cold though, so people will probably spend most of their time inside.
